# LendingClub Risk prediction
Risk assessment is a crucial element in financial services. Organizations want to forecast who would default on a consumer lending product. With a real-world dataset from LendingClub, we perform predictive analytics to predict loan default. LendingClub is a digital marketplace that offers personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The fintech company works with a network of investors, or peer-to-peer lenders, and connects them with consumers. Borrowers can choose from two loan terms - 36 or 60 months. When LendingClub gets new consumers, they want to know who will pay off the loan and who will not pay off for an extended period (Default). The scope of this project is to identify risky loan applicants with the knowledge of driving factors behind loan default, and the company can use that prediction to decide either to reject the loan application or lower the loan amount or increase the interest rate.
Exploratory data analysis and Preprocessing are done. Analysis with different models and data balancing techniques are also made to find out the model which performs best for the dataset. Hyperparameter tuning is then done to improve performance
